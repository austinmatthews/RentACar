For project 1 I was tasked with implementing both of the join methods. They were equ-join and natural join.
The equ-join joins tables based on matching attributes given by the user in a query. 
Natural join joins two tables based on all of their matching attributes. If there are multiple attributes
in each table that are the same, then all tuple values in each table for the corresponding attribute columns
must be equal. The remaining attributes in table2 are labeled as mismatched, and concatenated to the attributes
in table1. Also the domain lists are concatenated, and the tuples as well. The duplicate columns are also
eliminated in the new table. The only file I modified was the Table.java file. I provided a JoinTest.java file
to test the join methods. The complete list of files modified/created --
   -Table.java
   -MovieDB.java
   -JoinTest.java

If table2 in either join is null, then table1 is returned. If an attribute in equ-join is not part of it's 
respective table, then it will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, which will be caught and an empty table
is returned. The dimensions of the new table are based on the concatenation of both attributes and both domains. 
Also in the natural join, there is check so that are no duplicate attributes and no duplicate tuples either.
