Project 4
CSCI 4370

For this project I was tasked with writing PostgreSQL queries 2, 4, 6. I optimized the queries by adding indices.
I rewrote one of the queries (4), but the other two did not need fixed. I added indices based on the frequency of
the column use. I did not add an index on all columns used in my query because it is bad practice. It is bad practice because
the more indices you add, the slower the update and insert functions are. However I was able to speed up the queries quite a bit.
In addition to writing the psql queries 2,4,6, I was also wrote several other classes. I wrote the tableLoader.sql file.
This file created the tables for the database. Also I wrote the psqlConn.java class for database population. I used
the tupleGenerator from the last project to create random variables for hthe database. For the time trials I took an average
of 5 trials for each query before and after.
