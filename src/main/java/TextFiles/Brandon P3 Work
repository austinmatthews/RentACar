P3 Project

For this project I was in charge of testing the join method. I tested nested loop join, indexJoinB+Tree, indexJoinLinHash, and indexJoinTreeMap. I ran each of the indexed joins three times for each window of elements. 
For the indexed joins I used 100k elements to 1000k elemets, increasing by 100k each time. The nested loop join was considerably slower so I tested it with 20000 or less elements. I wrote a method in TestTupleGenerator.java called test join, and this is where I ran my tests. At the start of each trial I would just the index in the Table.java class, change the number of elements in the int [] tups array, and set the file to append the data to. I also specified if the joinTest method was going to call, indexJoin or regular join (nested loop). I also wrote the indexJoin() method in the Table.java file. I would manually run the three tests, after the three trials I would change the number of elements. Once I was finished I would change the index structure or which join method to call depending on the trial and repeat. This was an efficient way to do this, but I only had access to my computer for brief windows throughout the weekend so I thought a manual approach would be better in case I needed to end a trial abuptly, I didnt lose more data than necessary.
